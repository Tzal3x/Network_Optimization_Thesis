### Title:
Techniques for Solving Delay-Tolerant Network Utility Maximization Problems.

### Abstract:
In this work we present techniques for solving a class of Delay-Tolerant Utility Maximization Network problems applicable to wireless delay-tolerant networks. There are two approaches for the construction of solvers. One is the mathematical optimization approach and the other is the development of heuristic algorithms. 
For a better understanding of the intuition behind each method, we initially present a simplistic example of a problem, and then we gradually develop the rest of the underlying theory. Some solvers are better than others depending on the metrics we use to evaluate them. Therefore, after introducing a number of them, we continue by evaluating and comparing the solvers by applying them on different scenarios of the aforementioned network.
